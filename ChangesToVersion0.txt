Changes to standardized version (Version0)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Modified Features:
-Bouc-Wen links are activated only on the rotational degrees of freedom
-Bending and shear degrees of freedom are now coupled
-The option to assemble the Bouc-Wen bw_k coefficient from the EI coefficient
of the respective beam element is provided

Corresponding Changes:

-The input files have been modified to accomodate both the assembly of only
rotational springs and the modified boundary conditions implementation.

-The degrees of freedom not activated in the hysteretic links assume a linear
behavior modeled based on the maximum stiffness coefficient of the K matrix.

-An initial example of bending and shear coupling is provided, 
modeled based on beam equilibrium assumptions

-The option to assemble the Bouc-Wen spring bw_k coefficient from the EI 
coefficient of the neighbouring beam is included in the main file
(Input.BWkfromMAT=true option)

-Modified boundary conditions implementation by deleting bounded degrees of
freedom in the respective matrices + modified definition to make sure 
spring assembly is consistent

-A modified implementation of excitation for consistency purposes by
applying loads only on beam degrees of freedom (and not virtual dofs).


PS:
In postprocessing you need to check the proper dof to visualize the 
hysteresis curve as not all spring dofs are activated

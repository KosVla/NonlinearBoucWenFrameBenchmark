%Extract diagonal coefficients of M consistent
diagonal_coeff = diag(Mconsist);

%Compute total mass
total_mass = sum(sum(Mconsist));

%Get number s of diagonal coefficients of translational dofs
coeff_s = sum(diagonal_coeff(translational_dofs));

%Compute diagonal of lumped matrix
lumped_diag = diagonal_coeff * total_mass/coeff_s;

%Compute Lumped Mass Matrix
Mlumped = diag(lumped_diag);
